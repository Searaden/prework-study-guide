# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This is a study guide designed to assist in learning web development. This page was built to teach me fundamentals and prepare me for my upcoming classwork. This can now be used as a study guide for reference in my future projects to remember key terms and commands that otherwise may cause delays in production of future projects. I have learned basics for CSS, Javescript, GIT, and HTML
